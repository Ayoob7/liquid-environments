# Web-Based Cell Exploration in a Liquid environment.

This project was developed during my time as a visiting student researcher at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. A live demo of the application is available [here](https://ayoob7.github.io/liquid-environments/).

## Abstract 

The idea is to create an interactive Web-based intracellular environment where user would have an option of navigating within a single cell populated with mitochondria, nucleus and some other structures (e.g. Golgi apparatus, fusiform vesicles, â€¦). The demonstration would build upon Real-time Rendering of Liquid Environments Bachelor thesis (code available at: https://github.com/rokcej/liquid-environments) by creating and populating the scene and implementing the navigation.

We also developed the following features for the cellular environment.
1. Collision Detection
2. Floating function to simulate the sub surface tidal forces
3. Hemispherical Object positioning based on the golden spiral method.


## Examples
